# Spring Boot to Golang: A Journey from GoLang to Java Spring Boot

Welcome to my repository! ðŸš€ This project documents my journey as a seasoned Go developer transitioning to Java Spring
Boot. My aim is to deeply understand Spring Boot concepts, apply them effectively, and translate that knowledge into
GoLang, creating equivalent solutions where feasible.

---

## Why This Repository?

As a Go developer, I believe in clean code principles and solving problems with a deep understanding of the concepts.
This repository is my personal initiative to:

- Explore and master **Spring Boot** features.
- Compare Spring Boot concepts with **GoLang equivalents**.
- Document insights, challenges, and solutions for others making a similar transition.

---

## Objectives

1. **Understand the Fundamentals**  
   Dive into the core principles of Spring Boot, such as:
    - Inversion of Control (IoC)
    - Dependency Injection (DI)
    - Spring Bootâ€™s ecosystem and its "magic"

2. **Build Java Applications**  
   Create applications using Spring Boot to:
    - Learn project structures
    - Use Spring Boot's annotations and configurations
    - Implement clean and scalable solutions

3. **Translate to GoLang**  
   Develop GoLang equivalents of Spring Boot functionalities to:
    - Understand similarities and differences
    - Emphasize the adaptability of clean code across languages

4. **Share Knowledge**  
   Make the journey structured and readable for others transitioning to Spring Boot or vice versa.
